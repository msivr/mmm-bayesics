    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "In this notebook, we have examined the methodology for assessing the risk associated with various budget allocations, utilizing distinct strategies. We have also demonstrated how to generate an optimal budget allocation that aligns with a specified risk tolerance criterion. Three separate risk assessment metrics were employed: the Mean Tightness Score (MTS), Value at Risk (VaR), and a custom criterion that integrates both the mean tightness score and the diversification ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps  \n",
    "It is essential to recognize that not all risk assessment criteria are compatible with the output without appropriate transformations. For instance, to compute the VaR, we analyzed the Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) distribution; utilizing the response distribution directly would not adhere to the assumptions inherent in the VaR formula, potentially resulting in inconsistent or nonsensical outcomes.\n",
