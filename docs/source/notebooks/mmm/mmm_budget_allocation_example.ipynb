    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Before jumping into the data, letâ€™s first define the business problem we are trying to solve.In a progressively competitive scenario, marketers are tasked with distributing a predetermined marketing budget across various channels for optimizing Return on Investment (ROI). Consider a forthcoming quarter wherein a marketing team must decide the division of its operations between two advertising channels, represented as x1 and x2. These could effectively symbolize any medium, such as TV, digital advertising, print, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task lies in making decisions that invoke data, comply with factual evidence, and align with business logic. For instance, how can one incorporate prior information like budget restrictions, platform trends, constraints, or even distinctive features of each channel into the decision-making process?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Budget Allocation Function\n",
    "The updated budget allocation function in PyMC-Marketing aims to tackle this issue by offering a Bayesian framework for optimal allocation. This enables marketers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integrate the outcomes of Media Mix Modeling (MMM), quantifying each channel's effectiveness in metrics like ROI, incremental sales, etc.\n",
    "* Merge this empirical data with prior business knowledge and logic for making holistic and robust decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing this function, marketers can guarantee that the budget spread not only obeys the mathematical rigor furnished by the MMM outcomes but also incorporates business-specific factors, thereby achieving a balanced and optimized budget plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "Media Mix Modeling (MMM) acts as a dependable method to estimate the contribution of each channel (e.g., x1, x2) to a target variable like sales or any variable. The function `plot_direct_contribution_curves()` allows for visualization of this direct channel impact. However, it is crucial to remember that this only unveils the \"observable space\" for values of X (spend) and Y (contribution)."

    "\n",
    "Let's understand a few saturation functions with a few examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Saturation Functions: Sigmoid and Michaelis-Menten\n",
    "What do we mean by saturation functions? We assume the effect of spend on sales is not linear and saturates at some point. Two prevalent functions deployed to comprehend and estimate the saturation effects in advertising channels are the sigmoid and the Michaelis-Menten functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid Function\n",
    "The sigmoid function is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda x)}{1 + \\exp(-\\lambda x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Elements:\n",
    "* Î² (beta): Denotes the Asymptotic Maximum or Ceiling Value. It is the point that the function approaches as the input x becomes immense.\n",
    "* Î» (Lambda): Influences the steepness of the curve. A more substantial value of Î» renders the curve steeper, while a lesser value makes it more even-paced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Michaelis-Menten Function\n",
    "The Michaelis-Menten function is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\alpha \\times x}{\\lambda + x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Elements:\n",
    "* Î± (Alpha or Vmax): It represents the maximum contribution (y) a channel can make, also recognized as the plateau point.\n",
    "* Î» (k): Denotes the elbow on the function in x, signifying the moment when the curve adjusts its direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which Function to Use?\n",
    "The preference between the sigmoid and Michaelis-Menten functions ought to be steered by the data's goodness of fit. But it really comes down to your assumptions about where the peak might be and the speed at which it saturates the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: When you're choosing a saturation function, it's helpful to consider the data you already have. While saturation functions may have different parameterizations, they all have the same effect. If you already know about any relationship between spending and response, it's a good idea to pick a function with the same parameter values. This will help you understand and analyze its operation and outcomes better, which is essential within the Bayesian framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these parameters are obtained, you can visualize it using the `arviz.summary` function (each parameter has the prefix `saturation` or `adstock` respectively) and, if desired, you can recreate the curves for each channel independently based on them. More crucially, these parameter values are indispensable when using the `budget_allocator` function, which leverages this information to optimize your marketing budget across distinct channels. This section is fundamental to budget optimization."

    "## Example Use-Cases\n",
    "The `budget_allocator` function within PyMC-Marketing boasts a myriad of applications that can solve various business predicaments. Here, we present five critical use cases that exemplify its utility in real-world marketing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we optimizing?\n",
    "Before jumping into the examples, we need to understand the basis of our optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to optimize the allocation of budgets across multiple channels to maximize the overall contribution to key performance indicators (KPIs), such as sales or conversions. Each channel has its own sigmoid or michaelis-menten curve, representing the relationship between the amount spent and the resultant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These curves vary in characteristics: some channels saturate quickly, meaning that additional spending yields diminishing returns, while others may offer more linear growth in contribution with increased spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this optimization problem, we employ the Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming ([SLSQP](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-slsqp.html#optimize-minimize-slsqp)) algorithm, a gradient-based optimization technique. SLSQP is well-suited for this application as it allows for the imposition of both equality and inequality constraints, ensuring that the budget allocation adheres to business rules or limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by iteratively approximating the objective function and constraints using quadratic functions and solving the resulting sub-problems to find a local minimum. This enables us to effectively navigate the multidimensional space of budget allocations to find the most efficient distribution of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer aims to maximize the total contribution from all channels while adhering to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Budget Limitations: The total spending across all channels should not exceed the overall marketing budget.\n",
    "2. Channel-specific Constraints: Some channels may have minimum or maximum spending limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the SLSQP algorithm, we can optimize the multi-channel budget allocation in a rigorous, mathematically sound manner, ensuring that we get the highest possible return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximizing Contribution\n",
    "Assume you're managing the marketing for a retail company with a substantial budget to allocate for advertising across multiple channels. Suppose you're already apportioning funds to channels x1 and x2. Still, you're contemplating ways to optimize the forthcoming quarter's outlay to maximize the overall contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without, you might have considered scattering your money linearly without an MMM model - equal investments in each channel. However, you wish to explore better alternatives now that you possess an MMM model. Given that you lack prior knowledge, you impose the same restrictions on both channels. They must each expend a minimum of 1 million euros and no more than 5 million, equating to your total budget."

    "## Other methods to explore\n",
    "Even if the method is promising, use other optimization options which includes the full posterior could be a powerful and interesting solution as it's described on the following blog [\"Using bayesian decision making to optimize supply chains\"](https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/01/14/supply_chain/)\n",

    "The current methodology is similar to the ones used on other libraries as [Robyn from Meta](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/docs/features/#budget-allocation) and Google [Lightweight from Google](https://github.com/google/lightweight_mmm). You can explore the solutions and compare if needed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "MMM models and methodologies used here are designed to bridge the gap between theoretical rigor and actionable marketing insights. They represent a significant stride towards a more data-driven, analytical approach to marketing budget allocation, which could change how organizations invest in customer acquisition and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is a promising tool, it is essential to highlight that this methodology and software release is still experimental. Like any emerging technology, it comes with inherent limitations and assumptions that users should be aware of. The models can offer actionable insights, but they should be cautiously used and in tandem with various forms of analysis. Context is crucial, and while models aim to encapsulate general trends, they might not account for all nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, your engagements, feedback, and thoughts are not merely welcomed but actively solicited to make this tool as practical and universally applicable as possible."
